# Production Scaling Plan
## Overview
This document outlines the current limitations of the workflow automation system and provides a detailed plan for scaling it to handle production workloads effectively.


## Current POC Limitations
- No API authentication or authorization
- File-based storage doesn't scale
- Single-threaded execution
- Workflows run sequentially, blocking other operations
- No retry mechanisms, error handling is basic.
- Basic logging, no metrics or tracing - Difficult to monitor and debug prod issues and monitor performance

## Scaling Plan
### 1. Storage Layer
- **Current State**: File-based storage
- **Goal**: Use a database for persistent storage
- **Action Items**:
  - Migrate workflow definitions and run data to a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL)
  - Implement a schema for workflows, runs, and steps
  - Use an ORM (e.g., SQLAlchemy) for database interactions
  - Ensure data integrity and consistency with transactions
  - Implement indexing for performance on frequently queried fields
  - Add backup and recovery mechanisms for the database
  - Implement data migration scripts to transition from file-based storage to the database
  - Ensure database connection pooling for efficient resource usage

### 3. Message Queue Integration
- **Current State**: No message queue
- **Goal**: Use a message queue for asynchronous task execution
- **Action Items**:
  - Integrate a message queue (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka) for task distribution
  - Implement producers and consumers for workflow steps
  - Ensure idempotency in step execution to handle retries
  - Use message acknowledgments to ensure reliable processing
  - Implement dead-letter queues for failed messages
  - Monitor message queue health and performance

### 4. Retry Mechanisms
- **Current State**: No retry mechanisms
- **Goal**: Implement robust retry mechanisms for failed steps and circuit breakers
- **Action Items**:
  - Implement retry logic with exponential backoff for failed steps
  - Use circuit breakers to prevent cascading failures
  - Log retry attempts and failures for monitoring
  - Allow configuration of retry policies per step or workflow

### 5. Logging and Monitoring
- **Current State**: Basic logging, no metrics or tracing
- **Goal**: Implement structured logging, metrics, and distributed tracing
- **Action Items**:
  - Use a structured logging library (e.g., Loguru, structlog) for better log management
  - Implement metrics collection using Prometheus or similar tools
  - Use distributed tracing to trace workflow execution across services
  - Set up dashboards and alerts for monitoring workflow health and performance
  - Ensure logs are stored in a centralized location (e.g., ELK stack)
  - Implement log rotation and retention policies to manage log size

### 6. API Enhancements
- **Current State**: Basic REST API and no authentication
- **Goal**: Enhance API with authentication, authorization, and better error handling
- **Action Items**:
  - Implement JWT-based authentication for API endpoints
  - Add role-based access control (RBAC) for sensitive operations
  - Improve error handling with standardized error responses
  - Document the API using OpenAPI/Swagger
  - Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse of the API
  - Ensure API versioning for backward compatibility

### 7. Deployment and Scalability
- **Current State**: Single instance deployment
- **Goal**: Use containerization and orchestration for scalable deployment
- **Action Items**:
  - Set up CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment
  - Ensure environment configuration is managed through environment variables or config files
  - Implement secrets management for sensitive data (e.g., API keys, database credentials)
